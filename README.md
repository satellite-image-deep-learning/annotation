## Introduction to annotation
For supervised machine learning, you will require annotated images. For example if you are performing object detection you will need to annotate images with bounding boxes. Check that your annotation tool of choice supports large image (likely geotiff) files, as not all will. Note that GeoJSON is widely used by remote sensing researchers but this annotation format is not commonly supported in general computer vision frameworks, and in practice you may have to convert the annotation format to use the data with your chosen framework. There are both closed and open source tools for creating and converting annotation formats. Some of these tools are simply for performing annotation, whilst others add features such as dataset management and versioning. Note that self-supervised and active learning approaches might circumvent the need to perform a large scale annotation exercise. Note that tiffs/geotiffs cannot be displayed by most browsers (Chrome), but CAN render in Safari.

## Annotation formats
Note there are many annotation formats, although PASCAL VOC and coco-json are the most commonly used. I recommend using geojson for storing polygons, then converting these to the required format when needed.
* PASCAL VOC format: XML files in the format used by ImageNet
* coco-json format: JSON in the format used by the 2015 COCO dataset
* YOLO Darknet TXT format: contains one text file per image, used by YOLO
* Tensorflow TFRecord: a proprietary binary file format used by the Tensorflow Object Detection API
* Many more formats listed [here](https://roboflow.com/formats)
* OBB: orinted bounding boxes are polygons representing rotated rectangles
